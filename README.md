# Bud--Graduation-project
#Unity

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) game designed for children (ages 5 and above) using the Unity Engine. It aims to immerse them in Islamic heritage through a fun and engaging experience.

The first story we developed focuses on Prophet Yunus (peace be upon him), bringing his journey to life in an interactive way. Our goal is to expand this project by incorporating more stories of the prophets in the future.
